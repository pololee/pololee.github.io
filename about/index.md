Welcome to Polo's Blog. This is a place where I share my thoughts, emtions and stories with all of you, friends and strangers. I was a second-year Ph.D. student at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) about several weeks ago. But now I am M.S. student and going to graduate by next week. It's a long story. I withdrew from the Ph.D. program and finished it with a M.S. degree. I am going to work as software engineer at [Appfolio](http://www.appfolio.com/), a started-up company at Santa Barbara.

I don't know how many words I should put it here to explain who is Polo. But I do want to say as much as I can. I notice that the space of sharing sorrow and happiness shrinks more as I become older. Luckily, I got this place. I am zealous in web development, especially in frontend, even though I don't grasp many coding and design skills. Here are two simple websites I have recently created.
  
  - [Wudired](http://pololee.github.io/wudired/). I created this for my best friend, wudired. I believe it is great. The layout, animation, color and font are great. However, he doesn't seem to like it :( In this website, I use a framework [full-page.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/). The idea of the color selection comes from [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). I got help from Yunlei with the animation part. There is still one more part I have to finish, which is to make it responsive.
  - [Rose-life](http://pololee.github.io/rose-life/). This is the last quarter I stay at UCLA. I have lived with those friend since I first landed on the land. I always think we should have something to keep our memories. So I decided to create this website. When I went over all the picture we took before, I was moved by them. Actually I was proud of making this website right after I finished it. But again people on this webpage except me seems not care it at all. It's OK. I alway speak it to myself.

There is always a way to keep memories. There is allways a way to get though the difficult time in everyday's life. You should believe, time will heal all regardless of how you feel right now.
