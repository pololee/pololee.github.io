As the title says, I want to slip away. My internship will end on Sept. 19. There are about two weeks left. I am afraid to go back to school. I am afraid to take the qualifying exam again. I am afraid that I may fail it again. I am afraid that I may not have funding next quarter. I am afraid to teach something that I am not fully understanding. Yeah, I am afraid of so many things. This sounds like I am a coward and looking for excuse. 

You may guess that I am thinking to quit my Ph.D.. But to be honest, I don't what I should do. I must admit that I enjoy the internship. I have learned a lot of stuff. They are far more interesting than NDN (Named Data Network). Ruby is much more adorable than C++. However, if I decide to quit, I will disappoint my parents, my brother and probably, myself. I hate people ask me this question. I want to slip away. I am always trying to get out of the question.

OK. Stop complain. "The sun also rises". I would like to recommend several Apps. The first one is [Cinch](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/), which is similar to [BetterTouchTool]. Cinch is much simpler than BetterTouchTool and it is also free. The second one is [myPoint Light](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mypoint-light-s/id518658487?mt=12). If you have the problem "where is my mouse", you should check it out. It is very useful when you teach a lecture or make presentation. The third one is [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). In simple words, it is a command-line virtual machine management tool. But it is far more than a simple tool. Take a little bit time to learn it and I am sure you will love it. 

Now, it is music time. I would like to recommend a rock band [Sum 41](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_41). The band is from Canada and has a lot of awesome songs. The first time that I heard of their song is when I was in high school. My friend introduced "Best of me" to me. It is really a beautiful song. After that, I found more songs of this band. They are energetic and rhythmic. Here is a short list:

- [Best of me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiFh_aHHpa4)
- [Over my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDAocZ_r76U)
- [With me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8z-qP34-1Y)
- [Still waiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO-mSLxih-c&list=AL94UKMTqg-9D2OW_pBujbtTMTeFiV-Uay)
- [Pieces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By7ctqcWxyM&list=AL94UKMTqg-9D2OW_pBujbtTMTeFiV-Uay)
- [The hell song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pE8ReA5cn4&list=AL94UKMTqg-9D2OW_pBujbtTMTeFiV-Uay)
- [There is no solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7vuDEU1iu0)

I really like the rhythm of "there is no solution". Hope you like it. Enjoy :)
