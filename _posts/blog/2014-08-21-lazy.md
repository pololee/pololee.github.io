We will have a tech retreat on Thursday and Friday this week given by the company. Actually, I don't like it since we have to pack up a lot of thing. You may not believe. We are supposed to take sleeping bag or sheet, blanket, shoes, clothes, etc. Anyway, we have to do it. Someone just helped me fix a small bug in this page. The dot between each social icon are now located at the center. 

Tonight, I didn't do any coding or fixing bugs. Will continue when come back on Friday. Well, I still want to recommend sth. to you. Here is a link to a chrome extension. It is called [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca), an awesome extension. It basically give you an awesome background image for you chrome default page. I googled for a while and eventually find the place where the extension gets those beautiful pictures. Here is the [link](http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper/downloads/date/any/). Check it out and you will love it.

I really like the picture in the post of yesterday. I am thinking to ask someone to help me take a photo of myself like that. I chat with my dear friend, wudired on QQ tonight. He is an awesome guy. He is a genius of coding. Sorry, I just have been in U.S for two years. My English is pretty bad. I am gonna setup the comment function on this blog. Then, you can tell me all my grammar mistakes. Good night :)
