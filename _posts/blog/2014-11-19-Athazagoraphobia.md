Have you heard of this word "Athazagoraphobia"? Here is a [guide](http://athazagoraphobia.net) to it. It starts with this sentence "Are you afraid of being forgotten, ignored, abandoned or forgetting? Then you might be suffering from a condition called athazagoraphobia." You probably have the feeling before or you are suffering from it right now when you are reading my blog. When it's late night, when you are alone or lonely, when you are running, when you lose your goal, when you want to say something, but don't know how to say and no one could understand you, you probably have the feeling of "athazagoraphobia". 

How do I know this term? I just happened to see it in an interesting app. It is called [uber-facts](http://uber-facts.com/). I felt understood when I saw this term and its definition. Sorry, I forgot where I got the above picture:(
