Hello, I am Polo. This is my blog. I will write it both in Chinese and English. 1000 words per day. Hope I can make it!

Got a bunch of meetings today. We were discussing a new payment project. Some parts of the discussion don't make any sense to me at all. The problem is that I am not familiar with all the previous work and issues. So I cannot give any good comments. Keep learning.

I just refined the blog page and added some social icons. Here is a pretty good source [Mono Social Icons Font](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/). BTW, the cover picture is from [Wallpaperswide](http://wallpaperswide.com/). There are plenty of awesome wallpapers. You defintely should check it out. I may need to change the color later to make it more consistent. Now it is only ``111`` words. It's time to go to bed. Good night :)
