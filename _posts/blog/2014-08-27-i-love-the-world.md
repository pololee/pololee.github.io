I haven't been writing the blog for several days. Feel bad :( Actually, I made some changes in the css file and use **STFangSong** for Chinese characters. But I still want to take it as practice of English and hope it can give me some help. 

After dinner, I watched the video of Yonghao Luo and Ziru Wang's debate. If you have interest, you can search the two names on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsOvBAupaWjrpLGEpDlUolQ). I like Yonghao Luo and I am a big fan of him. He is an idealist. "Awesome life needs no explanation". This is kinda word by word translation. Does it make sense to you? You can see the title of this blog "I love the world". That is what he said after the launch conference of his first smartphone, [Smartisan T1](http://www.smartisan.com/). I am definitely gonna buy one :) The slogan is "**Born to be proud**".

I am not sure about you. There is alway a short time every month when I feel lonely. It just happens all of a sudden. You feel like no one cares about you and you are abandoned by the world. I want to talk to someone but they are not around. Just google and find this world "**maudlin**" (self-pityingly or tearfully sentimental, often through drunkenness.) I like it and it precisely expresses my feelings. Now, I think the blog would be a good place for me and write down several paragraphs to document my life. I guess no one would read this blog. I just assume that there is another polo, who is willing to listen to me. It is enough for me.

Well, as same as the previous blogs, I would like to recommend some apps and tools. Here are two Mac apps [Caffeine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12) and [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net/). By using Caffeine, just one click, you can keep you Mac from automatically going to sleep without several step configurations. It is very useful when you make a presentation or just leave your Mac for a while. If you don't have Apple ID, you can download it from [here](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/). If you miss the snap auto maximize and arrange window in Windows 7 and you use a mouse, you may want to try BetterTouchTool.

OK. Those are apps. Now I am gonna recommend some SONGS :) Actually, when I was a child, I wish I could be a musician in the future. Unfortunately, I am a software engineer now. But musician+software engineer would be the best combination. I have recently been listening to P!nk's song. I love her voice. It is so sexy. Here is a short list of what I am listening now.

- [Bridge of Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjr_983fKgM)
- [Funhouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdjtqu3XK4U)
- [So What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJfFZqTlWrQ)
- [I Don't Believe You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyMGerg6rnc)
- [Just Like A Pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDKGWaCglRM)
- [Are We All We Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IB8S2uWGws)
- [How Comes You're Not Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpeiMz_Qyro)
- [Fucking Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA_CzWdaGsg)
- [Try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqUFTWi1pVg)

All of links are youtube videos. "Bridge of Light" is a beautiful song from a film Happy Feet 2. I like the rhythm of "Are We All We Are" and "Just Like A Pill". You should check out "Fucking Perfect". The MV is aaaaaawesome! Enjoy! Have a good night :)
